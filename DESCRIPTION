Description: A comprehensive toolset for any
    useR conducting topological data analysis, specifically via the
    calculation of persistent homology in a Vietoris-Rips complex.
    The tools this package currently provides can be conveniently split
    into three main sections: (1) calculating persistent homology; (2)
    conducting statistical inference on persistent homology calculations;
    (3) visualizing persistent homology and statistical inference.
